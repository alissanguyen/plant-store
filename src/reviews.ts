      "I received my Spiritus Sancti plant baby and it is gorgeous and healthy! Alissa's love of plants and what she does is amazing. It is reflected in her meticulous and thoughtful packaging. She included little gifts that say so much about her kind nature. Everything about my experience was perfect and I will continue to purchase from Alissa. Wishing her much success. ü•∞",
